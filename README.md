## Multiple Choice Game

In this assignment we had to create a multiple choice game with a ticking timer.
The user will be provided with an indication of correct of incorrect submission.
At the end of the game the user is able to in-put their name and the game ends.

I started off by creating my HTML with the shell of where my buttons would sit, where the questions would sit and the answers.
I then did some basic styling to ensure it was easy for a user to navigate.
The hardest part was writing the Javascript function to start the game and start the timer.
